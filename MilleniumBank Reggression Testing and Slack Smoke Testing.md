## The task aimed to enhance my skills in writing test cases for regression testing and creating a checklist for smoke testing.
#### Task 1
A developer from your team has made some changes to the payment functionality. Create 3 positive and 3 negative test cases for regression testing of the MillenniumBank mobile banking application. That is, this is a check to see if new problems have appeared after making changes to the existing functionality.
#### Task 2
Your QA team is involved in the development of the Slack application before the release of a new version. To ensure the quality of the product and identify possible problems before its release, you need to create a checklist for conducting smoke testing.
Task: Create a checklist for smoke testing the Slack application. This checklist should contain at least 10 items that cover the main functionality of the application and its interaction with the user. It is necessary to take into account the main features that users often use when interacting with the Slack application.
Analyze the Slack application and create a smoke testing checklist in a template. The description of the check in the checklist should be formulated as a process.
