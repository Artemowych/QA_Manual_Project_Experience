## Doing this task I learnt how to:
1. Create JSON and XML files
2. Describe information about people using JSON and XML
3. Store data in a structured format
4. Use online editors for JSON and XML

## Task:
1. A list of 4 people is given. Each person has a unique id, name, residential address and contacts.
2. You need to describe information about these people and enter it into files.
3. Save these files in JSON and XML formats.
   ## Important
<ol start="1">
<li>The "address" element must contain 4 nested elements: city, street, house and apartment number.</li>
<li>The "contacts" element must contain 3 nested elements: phone number, email and username in "Telegram".</li>
<li>Each element must contain the appropriate information. The name of the elements can be chosen at your discretion, but in such a way that it reflects the essence of the task and begins with a lowercase letter, for example, telephoneNumber.</li>
<li>All data about people can be selected randomly and not carry any real information.</li>
</ol>
